"And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that
 when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your
 God." - Mosiah 2:17

"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath
 commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall 
 prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them." - 1 Nephi 3:7

"And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, 
the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty
winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon
you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because 
of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build 
they cannot fall." - Helaman 5:12
