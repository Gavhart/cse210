"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath

"And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, 
the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty
winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon
you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because 
of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build 
they cannot fall." - Helaman 5:12

"And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words

 in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto
  me; and they teach all men that they should do good." - 2 Nephi 33:10

"And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own,
 is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, 
 beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things." - Moroni 7:45
